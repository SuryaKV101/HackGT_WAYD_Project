# HackGT: WAYD Project (Privacy Controller)

Inspiration:		The inspiration behind this project began with the idea of personal privacy. There are many security threats nowadays that directly relate to personal security such as stalkers peeking at computer screens and looking at personal information like login info that could help them find out other valuable information and steal important assets. This is one of the main use cases for our program.

What WAYD does: 		Our program takes the user's webcam input on their computer and analyzes it. It is able to determine if there is movement in a user-specified region of the webcam input, and if there is movement it switches tabs to anything the user wants.

How WAYD was built: 		We built our program using popular python libraries such as pandas and cv2. We used great detail to determine what would be tracked, what would happen when movement was detected, and how efficiently the code would work when we run it. We wanted to make this application as applicable to the real world as we could.

Obstacles in the construction of WAYD: 		Some challenges we ran into while working on this project include time constraints such as the limited 36 hours that we had to complete this program. Another challenge was utilizing libraries that we weren't too familiar with as we had to learn as we were going. Collaborating was also an issue in the beginning, but with Pycharm's "Code with me" feature it was easy to collaborate on the same piece of code all at once.

Accomplishments: 		As first-year CS students creating a program in itself that we found to be practical and useful in our everyday lives was something, we are proud of accomplishing. This was an idea that we wanted to implement thinking about the issues we face daily and this is basically a cheat code to daily life and would actually be something we would use daily.

What we learned through WAYD: 		By creating this program we learned a lot about how different libraries function with each other. We also learned how important it is to write efficient code. There were multiple moments where we were overcomplicating code that could've been written in 1-5 lines. Overall we learned how to work as a team and create a refined product that we are proud of.

The future of WAYD: 		The future of WAYD is bright as this is just the forefront of the technologies we will continue to build that will make the everyday lives of everyday people on this planet easier. Innovation that eases everyday processes and does it with a unique approach is something that is astonishing and we would love to create more products that piggyback off of WAYD.
